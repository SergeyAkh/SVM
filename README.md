# Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm.

Here is overview of my approach to understand the SVM method and apply my custom realization on the real dataset, such as Breast Cancer Dataset<br />

<br />1. Feature corralation analisies

<br />2. Feature selection with Decision tree

<br />3. Custom model training

In result F1 score for test data exceed 0.96 wich is preaty good.

And the separating hyperplane is shown in chart
